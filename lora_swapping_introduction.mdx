The pyq Document Mistral LORA Swapping API allows you to upload your PEFT LORA adapters for Mistral 7B, and then run inference on any of them with the same API. 

This can be used to manage your fine-tuned models, or to manage your different fine-tuned versions. 

### Adapters

Adapters are [LORA PEFT](api-reference/embeddings_api/upload-post) adapters of [Mistral](api-reference/embeddings_api/update-post).

### Adapter Names

Adapters are organized by their names; these are set [here](api-reference/lora_head_api/upload-adapter-post) when you first upload the adapter.
